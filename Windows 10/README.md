# Dotfiles for Windows-based Environments

This directory holds the scripts, config files & other arbitrary files necessary to set up a development environment on Windows. As is the case with most dotfile projects, this a work-in-progress project as well. Changes to this project will be made as & when required.

## Software to Install

### Development Needs

This section lists the necessary software that will be automatically installed as per requirements. That said, here are the software that I use on my Windows development machine(s):

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - For writing code
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - For developing Python applications
- [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) - For Git Version Control
- [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) - Terminal emulator for Windows
- [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/download/#windows) - For testing rest APIs which is also a good alternative to Postman.
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) - For Python package management
- [Oh my Posh v3](https://ohmyposh.dev/) - For cross-platform prompt customizations
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) - For cross-platform, Terminal-based editor which is also a good Vim alternative

### Miscellaneous Needs

In addition to the aforementioned development-specific applications, I need some more miscellaneous applications as well. For example, Steam for gaming & Discord for general purpose VoIP communications. The following are a list of those applications:

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) - For gaming
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) - For general purpose VoIP communication

- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en_fj/drive/download/) - For syncing local files with Google Drive

### Optional Needs

Some software are required optionally as dependencies, perhaps to run Netlify or other software. This section lists these software.

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/)
