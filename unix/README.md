# Dotfiles for Linux/MacOS Environments

This directory holds the dotfiles for my Unix-based development environments & it's a work-in-progress project. Nothing exists here in the folder yet since my current choice of a development environment is Windows 10.

When I do have access to a Unix-based development environment, I'll update it accordingly.
