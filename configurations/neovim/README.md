# Neovim Configurations

[Neovim][Neovim] is a fork of the original [Vim][Vim]. If you are on an Unix-like system, chances are, it already comes pre-packaged with it. But for Windows, you need to resot to other means. But do note, even though Vim is available on Windows, it's not as user-friendly as it is on Unix-like systems. It's too buggy & configuring it can be a struggle as well.

To tackle with the issues Vim poses on Windows platforms, Neovim comes in as a viable alternative. It's not as buggy as it's vanilla alternative. And is pretty easy to configure as well due to it's sensible default settings. And if you need help learning more about Neovim, do check out their official documentations.

That said, this directory holds everything that I use to configure my Neovim environment.

**Note**: I've only recently started using Neo(vim) & hence my current settings are very crude. They're subject to constant change, so be wary of what you copy. So, if you're curious about something or just plain confused, then reach out to me.
