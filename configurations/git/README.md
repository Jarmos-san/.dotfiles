# Git Version Control

If you're reading this document, I assume you don't need an introduction to Git. So, let's fast-forward to the important details.

This directory holds all the necessary `dotfiles` that Git needs to work as you expect it to. More specifically, these `dotfiles` configure Git to suit your tastes & work preferences. So, following are the list of files & a brief explanation of what they're used for;

- `.gitattributes`: Is used to specify particular attributes of files in the pathname. It's recommended to add repository specific `.gitattribute` file for better collaboration. More information is available at: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes
- `.gitconfig`: The "main" file which configures Git according to the user's preferences. More info is available at: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config
- `.gitignore`: A global `.gitignore` so that Git doesn't commit unecessary files to VCS by accident. More info is available at: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore 

**NOTE**: On Windows, these files are expected to be placed at `$HOME` which is also equivalent to the `%USERPROFILE%` Environment Variable. Feel free to peruse through the `.gitconfig` file to understand how my Git workflow works.

## Explaining My `.gitconfig` File Line-By-Line

Will be updated soon enough. Come back when I've detailed this section.
